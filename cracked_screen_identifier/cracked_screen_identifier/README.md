cracked_screen_identifier
==============================

This projects presents the complete end-to-end ML cycle of the cracked_screen_identifier app; an image classification project. Cracked_screen_identifier takes a phone image and predicts if the screen is broken or not. The simple web interface written with streamlitt and hosted with huggingface and  is available on the [Cracked_screen_identifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/olumide/Cracked_Screen_Identifier).

This project was developed to ensure reproducibility.The project is structured below:
